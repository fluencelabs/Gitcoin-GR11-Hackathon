# Gitcoin-GR11-Hackathon

Welcome to the Gitcoin GR11 hackathon. We are excited to join you in pushing the Web3 envelope over the next six days and we are looking forward to support you in turning your ideas into decentralized realities.

## About Fluence

Fluence provides the infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the the Fluence peer-to-peer network host content-addressable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distribute systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As as result, the Fluence platform allows you to bring peer-to-peer compute to a variety of Web3 use cases including data storage, blockchains, identity and to develop custom hosted services and workflows using the Fluence stack.

## The Prizes

Fluence provides named prizes of $500 each for up to three best and unique submissions for each of the following categories:

* Write a tutorial on a use case of your choosing on how to integrate Fluence and Aqua with one or more of IPFS, Ceramic or Textile. The tutorial should be ready for Medium publication and the associated code should be provided in a Github or Gitlab repo with MIT/Apache 2.0 license. For example, you could use Fluence to create NFTs on one or more protocols and Aqua to compose the workflow over Fluence compute and (mutable) decentrazlied storage.

* Write a tutorial on a use case of your choosing that shows how to use [IPLD](https://ipld.io/) with Fluence and Aqua with one or more of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot or Avalanche. The tutorial should be ready for Medium publication and the associated code should be provided in a Github or Gitlab repo with MIT/Apache 2.0 license. For example, you could use Fluence and Aqua to index and search IPFS hosted blogs and websites.

* Write a tutorial on a use case of your choosing on how to use Decentralized Identities (DID) or Verifiable Credentials (VC)w ith Fluence and Aqua from the issuer, holder and/or verifier perspectives.  The tutorial should be ready for Medium publication and the associated code should be provided in a Github or Gitlab repo with MIT/Apache 2.0 license. For example, you could use Fluence to create a distributed and decentralized verifier for Verifiable Credentials.
